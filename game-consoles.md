## Game Consoles

Console type Raspberry Pi (or maybe x86 machine) running Linux and a captive browser to play games developed by the GDP 1 and 2 classes. Use a Rails app to manage access to the games:
* Authenticate so that we can get stats on unique and repeat plays and user demographics.
* Publish game by pushing to a web page.
* Timed access if necessary.
* Multiple machines - maybe even at middle schools.
